# Introduction

CitiesXML is a small demo using XSL to render XML.
The CitiesXML_Copy file is a copy of the original one located [HERE](https://github.com/camillebalima/XMLDemo/tree/main/FileIO/src/citiesXML/).
The XML file as been generated using the Java FileIO project. It contains all the Cities, Population and Country code from the built in world database from MySQL.
