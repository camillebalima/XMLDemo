# Introduction

CitiesXLSX is a small demo using Excel spreadsheet and VBA Macros. It demostrates the following:
* Import an XML file into Exel
* Format the table
* Export execl spreadsheet to a generated XML file.


 # What I learned about Macros

   * EXCEL MACRO is a record and playback tool that simply records your Excel steps 
   * The macro will play it back as many times as you want.
   * VBA Macros save time as they automate repetitive tasks.

   * First I have to show the developer option with the following instruction (Only the first time)
   ** On the File tab, go to Options > Customize Ribbon.
   ** Under Customize the Ribbon and under Main Tabs, select the Developer check box.

   
   * It is possible to assign a macro to a button in excel
   * It is possible to record a macro and do some tasks before ending it
   * It is also possible to write all the code in Visual Basics

 # Conclusion
 This is my first experience with VBA Macros and excel. It was more diffictult for me to do this project but I am happy with what I have been able to do for a first projectL. I understand how important it is and I actually love the concept.
